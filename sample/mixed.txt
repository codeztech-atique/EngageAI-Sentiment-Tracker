Dear Customer,

I hope this message finds you well. Despite multiple efforts on our side, there has been a noticeable lack of communication regarding the upgrade of the Zoom Meeting SDK from version 2.18.2 to 3.1.6. This silence has unfortunately caused significant delays and is now impacting the overall progress of the upgrade.

We understand that situations may arise that make responding difficult. However, the absence of timely feedback not only jeopardizes this upgrade but also puts future support at risk. If we continue without your input, it could lead to more complications down the road.

While we are still here to support you, the current lack of engagement has left us in a position where, without immediate action, we may need to close the ticket by the end of the day. Reopening it later would require restarting the entire process, which could introduce further delays and setbacks.

We appreciate your attention to this matter, but the urgency of the situation cannot be overstated.
