Dear Customer,

I am compelled to express my profound dissatisfaction with your continued neglect regarding the mandatory upgrade of the Zoom Meeting SDK from version 2.18.2 to 3.1.6. Despite explicit instructions and multiple reminders, your failure to respond has severely hindered our operational capabilities and breached our agreed terms of engagement.

This is unacceptable and demonstrates a lack of professionalism and respect for the critical nature of this upgrade. Your inaction has not only stalled this process but has also cast serious doubts on your commitment to maintaining the necessary standards of our partnership.

Immediate Action Required: If there is no engagement from your side by the close of business today, we will be forced to escalate this matter. The ticket will be closed, and any subsequent actions on your part will necessitate a new, more rigorous process, likely incurring delays and additional costs.

Consider this communication a final warning. Any further disregard will lead to more severe repercussions.
